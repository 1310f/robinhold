## Ideas for Future Work
***

### Buy/Sell stocks

Users should be able to buy any stocks on the market given enough cash value in theri accounts.
Users aslo should be able to sell any shares of stocks that they are holding. Cash value will update according to the transactions.

### User profile page

Users will have a profile page to show their personal information and their current cash value and stock holdings. Historic transactions record will be a plus.
